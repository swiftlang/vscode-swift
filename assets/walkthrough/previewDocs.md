# Preview Documentation
![Preview documentation](./images/previewDocumentation.gif)

You can preview [documentation written using DocC](https://www.swift.org/documentation/docc/) directly in VS Code by using the Preview Swift Documentation button at the top right of an editor, or by invoking `Swift: Preview Documentation` in the command palette in a `.docc` bundle. The preview window will update as you open different Markdown files or Swift source files that contains documentation comments.

Note: This feature requires Swift 6.2 or later.
