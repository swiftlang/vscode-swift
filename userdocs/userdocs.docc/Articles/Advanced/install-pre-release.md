# Installing Pre-Release Builds

Try out the latest updates by switching to the pre-release version.

The Swift extension provides pre-release builds that can be used to test out unreleased features or get bug fixes before an official release can be published. Pre-release build numbers are always one minor version ahead of the most recent release.

The "Switch to Pre-Release Version" button in the VS Code extensions view is used to install the latest pre-release builds:

A "Switch to Release Version" button will appear in its place that lets you go back to the official release.
