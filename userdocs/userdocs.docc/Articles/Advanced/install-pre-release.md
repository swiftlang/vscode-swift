# Installing Pre-Release Builds

Try out the latest updates by switching to the pre-release version.

The Swift extension provides pre-release builds that you can use to test out unreleased features or get bug fixes before the project publishes an official release. Pre-release build numbers are one minor version ahead of the most recent release.

The "Switch to Pre-Release Version" button in the VS Code extensions view is used to install the latest pre-release builds:

When you select to use a pre-release version, the button changes to "Switch to Release Version", which lets you go back to the official release.
