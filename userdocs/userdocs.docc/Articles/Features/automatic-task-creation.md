# Automatic Task Creation

Add tasks for common operations with your Package.

For workspaces that contain a `Package.swift` file, the Swift extension adds the following tasks:

- **Build All**: Build all targets in the Package.
- **Build Debug <Executable>**: Each executable in a Package.swift get a task for building a debug build.
- **Build Release <Executable>**: Each executable in a Package.swift get a task for building a release build.

> ðŸ’¡ Tip: Tasks use workflows common to all VS Code extensions. For more information see [the VS Code documentation for tasks](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks).

These tasks are available via the commands **Terminal â–¸ Run Task...** and **Terminal â–¸ Run Build Task...** in the command palette.
