# Language Features

vscode-swift provides various language features to help you write Swift code.

The extension provides language features such as code completion and jump to definition via [SourceKit-LSP](https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp). To ensure the extension functions correctly, itâ€™s important to first build the project so that SourceKit-LSP has access to all the symbol data. Whenever you add a new dependency to your project, make sure to rebuild it so that SourceKit-LSP can update its information.
