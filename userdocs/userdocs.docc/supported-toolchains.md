# Supported Toolchains

vscode-swift supports several versions of the Swift toolchain.

vscode-swift supports the following Swift toolchains:
 * 5.9
 * 5.10
 * 6.0
 * 6.1

The extension also strives to work with the latest nightly toolchains built from the main branch.

Certain features of vscode-swift will only work with newer versions of the toolchains. We recommend using the latest version of the Swift toolchain to get the most benefit of the extension. The following features only work with certain toolchains as listed:
