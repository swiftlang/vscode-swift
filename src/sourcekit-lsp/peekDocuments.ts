 * Opens a peeked editor in `uri` at `position` having contents from `locations`.
 *
 * **NOTE**:
 * - If the `uri` is not open in the editor, this opens the `uri` in the editor and then opens a peeked editor.
 * - This closes any previously displayed peeked editor in `uri` and then, reopens a peeked editor in `uri` at
 *   the given `position` with contents from the new `locations`.
 *
 * @param uri The uri of the file in which a peeked editor is to be opened
 * @param position The position in the file in which a peeked editor is to be opened
 * @param locations The locations of the contents which has to be displayed by the peeked editor

    // #### NOTE - Undocumented behaviour of invoking VS Code's built-in "editor.action.peekLocations" command:
    // 1. If the `uri` is not open in the editor, it opens the `uri` in the editor and then opens a peeked editor.
    // 2. It always closes the previous peeked editor (If any)
    // 3. And after closing, It opens a new peeked editor having the contents of `locations` in `uri` **if and only
    //    if** the previous peeked editor was displayed at a *different* `position` in `uri`.
    // 4. If it happens to be that the previous peeked editor was displayed at the *same* `position` in `uri`, then it
    //    doesn't open the peeked editor window having the contents of new `locations` at all.

    // As (4.) says above, if we invoke "editor.action.peekLocations" on a position in which another peeked editor
    // window is already being shown, it won't cause the new peeked editor window to show up at all. This is not the
    // ideal behaviour.
    //
    // For example:
    // If there's already a peeked editor window at the position (2, 2) in "main.swift", its impossible to close this
    // peeked editor window and open a new peeked editor window at the same position (2, 2) in "main.swift" by invoking
    // the "editor.action.peekLocations" command in a single call.
    //
    // *The ideal behaviour* is to close any previously opened peeked editor window and then open the new one without
    // any regard to its `position` in the `uri`.

    // In order to achieve *the ideal behaviour*, we manually close the peeked editor window by ourselves before
    // opening a new peeked editor window.
    //
    // Since there isn't any API available to close the previous peeked editor, as a **workaround**, we open a dummy
    // peeked editor at a different position, causing the previous one to close irrespective of where it is. After
    // which we can invoke the command again to show the actual peeked window having the contents of the `locations`.
