/**
 * Request for semantic information about the symbol at a given location **(LSP Extension)**.
 *
 * This request looks up the symbol (if any) at a given text document location and returns
 * SymbolDetails for that location, including information such as the symbol's USR. The symbolInfo
 * request is not primarily designed for editors, but instead as an implementation detail of how
 * one LSP implementation (e.g. SourceKit) gets information from another (e.g. clangd) to use in
 * performing index queries or otherwise implementing the higher level requests such as definition.
 *
 * - Parameters:
 *   - textDocument: The document in which to lookup the symbol location.
 *   - position: The document location at which to lookup symbol information.
 *
 * - Returns: `[SymbolDetails]` for the given location, which may have multiple elements if there are
 *   multiple references, or no elements if there is no symbol at the given location.
 *
 * ### LSP Extension
 *
 * This request is an extension to LSP supported by SourceKit-LSP and clangd. It does *not* require
 * any additional client or server capabilities to use.
