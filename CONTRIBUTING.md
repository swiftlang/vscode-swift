# Welcome to the Swift Community!

Contributions to vscode-swift are welcomed and encouraged! Please see the [Contributing to Swift guide](https://www.swift.org/contributing/) and check out the [structure of the community](https://www.swift.org/community/#community-structure).

To be a truly great community, Swift needs to welcome developers from all walks of life, with different backgrounds, and with a wide range of experience. A diverse and friendly community will have more great ideas, more unique perspectives, and produce more great code. We will work diligently to make the Swift community welcoming to everyone.

To give clarity of what is expected of our members, Swift has adopted the code of conduct defined by the Contributor Covenant. This document is used across many open source communities, and we think it articulates our values well. For more, see the [Code of Conduct](https://www.swift.org/code-of-conduct/).

# Contributing to /vscode-swift

## Development

For setup and developer information, see the full [Contributors Documentation](./Contributor%20Documentation/README.md).

## Submitting a bug or issue

Please ensure to include the following in your bug report:
- A concise description of the issue, what happened and what you expected.
- Simple reproduction steps
- Version of the extension you are using
- Contextual information (Platform, Swift version etc)

## Submitting a Pull Request

Please ensure to include the following in your Pull Request (PR):
- A description of what you are trying to do. What the PR provides to the library, additional functionality, fixing a bug etc
- A description of the code changes
- Documentation on how these changes are being tested
- Additional tests to show your code working and to ensure future changes don't break your code.

Please keep your PRs to a minimal number of changes. If a PR is large, try to split it up into smaller PRs. Don't move code around unnecessarily as it makes comparing old with new very hard. If you have plans for a large change please talk to the maintainers of the project beforehand either on the [swift.org forums](https://forums.swift.org) in the [VS Code Swift Extension category](https://forums.swift.org/c/related-projects/vscode-swift-extension/) or in the `#vscode-swift` channel on the Swift Server Slack. You can [join the Slack workspace here](https://join.slack.com/t/swift-open-source/shared_invite/zt-1a3hxb9r5-8sFU3D7JUvaP5QO1AjSivg).
