# Swift for Visual Studio Code

This extension adds language support for Swift to Visual Studio Code, providing a seamless experience for developing Swift applications on all supported platforms. It supports:

* Code completion
* Jump to definition, peek definition, find all references, symbol search
* Error annotations and apply suggestions from errors
* Automatic generation of launch configurations for debugging with [LLDB DAP](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=llvm-vs-code-extensions.lldb-dap)
* Automatic task creation
* Package dependency view
* Test Explorer view

> **Note**  
> Most features of the Swift for Visual Studio Code extension only work with projects that build with Swift Package Manager. These projects will have a `Package.swift` file in their root folder. Support for Xcode projects (`.xcodeproj`) is limited.

# Documentation

The official documentation for this extension is [available on swift.org](https://docs.swift.org/vscode/documentation/userdocs).

This extension uses [SourceKit LSP](https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp) for the [language server](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/overviews/lsp/overview/), which powers code completion. It also has a dependency on the [LLDB DAP](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=llvm-vs-code-extensions.lldb-dap) extension to enable debugging.

To propose new features, you can post on the [swift.org forums](https://forums.swift.org) in the [VS Code Swift Extension category](https://forums.swift.org/c/related-projects/vscode-swift-extension/). If you run into something that doesn't work the way you'd expect, you can [file an issue in the GitHub repository](https://github.com/swiftlang/vscode-swift/issues/new).
