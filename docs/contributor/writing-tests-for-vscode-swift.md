# Writing Tests for the VS Code Swift Extension <!-- omit in toc -->

This document provides guidance to contributors on how to write test cases for contributions to the [VSCode Swift extension](https://github.com/swiftlang/vscode-swift) using **Mocha**, **Chai**, and **Sinon**. These tools are widely used for testing JavaScript/TypeScript code and will help ensure that your code is reliable and maintainable.

A brief description of each framework can be found below:

-   [**Mocha**](https://mochajs.org/): A JavaScript test framework that runs in Node.js. It provides structure for writing test suites, hooks (e.g., `setup()`, `teardown()`), and test cases (`test()`).
-   [**Chai**](https://www.chaijs.com/): An assertion library. It allows you to express expectations for your code’s behavior using natural language.
-   [**Sinon**](https://sinonjs.org/): A powerful mocking and spying library that allows you to create spies, stubs, and mocks to test how your code interacts with other components.

## Organizing Tests

Tests are currently organized into one of two directories:

1. **Unit Tests** - Tests that exercise smaller units of code go in `test/unit-tests`
2. **Integration Tests** - Tests that exercise more complicated features that require the extension to be loaded in VSCode go in `test/integration-tests`

There are plans to add a third set of smoke tests that will have no mocking at all and actually click through the VS Code user interface to perform actions. For more information see the [Swift for Visual Studio Code test strategy](./test-strategy.md) document.

## Writing Unit Tests

> [!NOTE]
> This section will guide you through contributing a simple test that mocks out some VS Code UI pieces. For more information on individual mocking methods, see the [Mocking Utilties](#mocking-utilities) section.

Unit tests should be organized in a way that reflects the structure of the project. For example, let's say you were writing unit tests for the [`showReloadExtensionNotification()`](../../src/ui/ReloadExtension.ts) function under `src/ui/ReloadExtensions.ts`. You would want to first create a unit test file that mirrors the structure of that feature’s implementation:

1. **Create a new test file** `test/unit-tests/ui/ReloadExtensions.ts` that will contain the test suite:

    ```
    test/unit-tests/ui/
      |- ReloadExtensions.test.ts
    ```

2. **Structure your test suite** using Mocha’s `suite()` function. This function allows you to group related tests together logically.

    ```typescript
    suite("ReloadExtension Unit Test Suite", function () {
        // Individual test cases will go here
    });
    ```

3. **Create your first test case** using Mocha's `test()` function. Your test name should clearly explain what the test is trying to verify.
    ```typescript
    suite("ReloadExtension Unit Test Suite", () => {
        test("displays a warning message asking the user to reload the window", async () => {
            // Test code goes here
        });
    });
    ```

Now comes the fun part! For unit testing we use [Chai](https://chaijs.com) for assertions and [Sinon](https://sinonjs.org/) for stubbing/mocking user interaction and observing behaviour that is otherwise difficult to observe. Many helpful utility functions exist in [MockUtils.ts](../../test/MockUtils.ts). These utility methods take care of the setup and teardown of the mocks so the developer does not need to remember to do this for each suite/test.

Our test is going to want to verify that a warning message is shown to the user. For this, we'll want to mock out VSCodes global `window` module. Thankfully, MockUtils contains a `mockGlobalObject` function that will replace a global object with a mocked version. Each property is replaced with a Sinon stub during setup and restored at teardown. Keep in mind that the `mockGlobal*` functions all need to be created at the **`suite()`** level. Unexpected behavior will occur if called within a `test()` function.

```typescript
import { expect } from "chai";
import { mockGlobalObject } from "../../MockUtils";
import * as vscode from "vscode";
import { showReloadExtensionNotification } from "../../../src/ui/ReloadExtension";

suite("ReloadExtension Unit Test Suite", () => {
    const mockedVSCodeWindow = mockGlobalObject(vscode, "window");

    test("displays a warning message asking the user if they would like to reload the window", async () => {
        // Define the mock behavior using methods on the Sinon stub
        mockedVSCodeWindow.showWarningMessage.resolves(undefined);
        // Execute the function that we're testing
        await showReloadExtensionNotification("Want to reload?");
        // Make sure that the warning was shown correctly
        expect(mockedVSCodeWindow.showWarningMessage).to.have.been.calledOnceWithExactly(
            "Want to reload?",
            "Reload Extensions"
        );
    });
});
```

Now let's test to see what happens when the user clicks the "Reload Extensions" button. VS Code provides a command to reload the window which will cause the extension to reload. We can verify that this command is executed:

```typescript
suite("ReloadExtension Unit Test Suite", () => {
    const mockedVSCodeWindow = mockGlobalObject(vscode, "window");
    const mockedVSCodeCommands = mockGlobalObject(vscode, "commands");

    // ... previous test case(s) here

    test("reloads the extension if the user clicks the 'Reload Extensions' button", async () => {
        // Define the mock behavior using methods on the Sinon stub
        mockedVSCodeWindow.showWarningMessage.resolves("Reload Extensions" as any);
        // Execute the function that we're testing
        await showReloadExtensionNotification("Want to reload?");
        // Make sure that the extension was reloaded
        expect(mockedVSCodeCommands.executeCommand).to.have.been.calledOnceWithExactly(
            "workbench.action.reloadWindow"
        );
    });
});
```

You may have also noticed that we needed to cast the `"Reload Extensions"` string to `any` when resolving `showWarningMessage()`. Unforunately, this may be necessary for methods that have incompatible overloaded signatures due to a TypeScript issue that remains unfixed.

## Mocking Utilities

This section outlines the various utilities that can be used to improve the readability of your tests. The [MockUtils](../../test/MockUtils.ts) module can be used to perform more advanced mocking than what Sinon provides out of the box. This module has its [own set of tests](../../test/unit-tests/MockUtils.test.ts) that you can use to get a feel for how it works.

### Mocking interfaces, classes, and functions

If you need a one-off mock of an Interface or Class that you can configure the behavior of, use `mockObject()`. This function requires a type parameter of the Interface or Class you're mocking as well as an object containing the properties you would like to mock. You can use this in combination with `mockFn()` to fully mock an object and define its default behavior in one line:

```typescript
import { expect } from "chai";
import { mockFn, mockObject } from "../MockUtils";

interface TestInterface {
    first: number;
    second: number;
    sum(): number;
}

test("can mock an interface", () => {
    const mockedInterface = mockObject<TestInterface>({
        first: 0,
        second: 0,
        sum: mockFn(s => s.callsFake(() => {
            return mockedInterface.first + mockedInterface.second;
        }));
    });

    mockedInterface.first = 17;
    mockedInterface.second = 13;
    expect(mockedInterface.sum()).to.equal(30);
});
```

Sometimes you will need to use the `instance()` method to convert from a MockedObject to the actual object. This is purely to avoid TypeScript errors and should only be necessary when dealing with complex types (E.g. a class with private properties):

```typescript
import { expect } from "chai";
import { mockFn, mockObject, instance } from "../MockUtils";

class TestClass {
    private first: number;
    private second: number;

    constructor(first: number, second: number) {
        this.first = first;
        this.second = second;
    }

    sum(): number {
        return this.first + this.second;
    }
}

function sumOfTestClass(test: TestClass): number {
    return test.sum();
}


test("can mock a class with private properties", () => {
    const mockedClass = mockObject<TestClass>({
        sum: mockFn();
    });

    mockedClass.sum.returns(42);
    expect(sumOfTestClass(instance(mockedInterface))).to.equal(42);
});
```

### Mocking VS Code events

The `AsyncEventEmitter` captures components listening for a given event and fires the event emitter with the provided test data:

```typescript
import { expect } from "chai";
import { mockObject, AsyncEventEmitter } from "../MockUtils";
import * as vscode from "vscode";

interface TestInterface {
    onDidGetNumber: vscode.Event<number>;
}

test("example of mocking an asynchronous event within a mocked object", async () => {
    // Create a new AsyncEventEmitter and hook it up to the mocked interface
    const emitter = new AsyncEventEmitter<number>();
    const mockedInterface = mockObject<TestInterface>({
        onDidGetNumber: mockFn(s => s.callsFake(emitter.event));
    });

    // A simple example of an asynchronous event handler
    const events: number[] = [];
    mockedInterface.onDidGetNumber(async num => {
        await new Promise<void>(resolve => {
            setTimeout(resolve, 1);
        });
        events.push(num);
    });

    // Use the fire() method to trigger events
    await emitter.fire(1);
    await emitter.fire(2);
    await emitter.fire(3);

    // Make sure that the events were triggered correctly
    expect(events).to.deep.equal([1, 2, 3]);
});
```

### Mocking global modules

Sometimes it is necessary to mock behavior that is provided by modules. A prime example of this is the VS Code API. In these cases you can use the global variants of the previously mentioned functions.

These global mocking functions automatically handle `setup()` and `teardown()` through Mocha so that you don't have to do this yourself. The only caveat is that the global methods must be called at the `suite()` level rather than inside a `test()` case:

```typescript
import { expect } from "chai";
import { mockGlobalObject } from "../MockUtils";
import * as vscode from "vscode";

suite("Mocking a Global Interface", async function () {
    // Runs Mocha's setup() and teardown() functions to stub out vscode.window automatically
    // Notice how this is a constant defined at the root of the suite() and not in test()
    const mockedVSCodeWindow = mockGlobalObject(vscode, "window");

    test("define behavior for a global function", async () => {
        mockedVSCodeWindow.showInformationMessage.resolves(undefined);

        // ... trigger and verify behavior
    });
});
```

#### Mocking global objects

`MockUtils` contains a method called `mockGlobalObject()` that can be used to mock an object that is part of a module:

```typescript
import { expect } from "chai";
import { mockGlobalObject } from "../MockUtils";
import * as vscode from "vscode";

suite("Mocking a Global Interface", async function () {
    const mockedVSCodeWindow = mockGlobalObject(vscode, "window");

    test("define behavior for a global function", async () => {
        mockedVSCodeWindow.showInformationMessage.resolves(undefined);

        // ... trigger and verify behavior
    });
});
```

#### Mocking global events

You may also want to mock a global event from the VS Code API using the `mockGlobalEvent()` function:

```typescript
import { expect } from "chai";
import { mockObject, mockGlobalEvent } from "../MockUtils";
import * as vscode from "vscode";

suite("Global event example", async function () {
    const didStartTask = mockGlobalEvent(vscode.tasks, "onDidStartTask");

    test("fire an event for onDidStartTask", async () => {
        // Fire the onDidStartTask event
        const mockedTask = mockObject<vscode.Task>({});
        mockedTaskExecution = { task: instance(mockedTask), terminate: () => {} };
        await didStartTask.fire({ execution: mockedTaskExecution });

        // ... verify behavior
    });
});
```

#### Setting global constants

The `mockGlobalValue()` function allows for temporarily overriding the value for some global constant:

```typescript
import { mockGlobalValue } from "../MockUtils";

suite("Process platform example", async function () {
    const processPlatform = mockGlobalValue(process, "platform")

    test("simulate being on Linux", async () => {
        processPlatform.setValue("linux");

        // ... trigger and verify behavior
    });
});
```

#### Mocking an entire module

The `mockGlobalModule()` function allows for mocking an entire module such as our internal `configuration` module:

```typescript
import * as configuration from "../../src/configuration.ts";

suite("Mocked configuration example", async function () {
    const mockedConfiguration = mockGlobalModule(configuration);

    test("simulate the user setting the path to swift in their settings", async () => {
        mockedConfiguration.path = "/path/to/swift";

        // ... trigger and verify behavior
    });
});
```
